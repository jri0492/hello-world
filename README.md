# hello-world
My first repository 

Dear Future Joe,

Greetings and Salutaitons! It's me, yourself, on May 16, 2021 at 11:24 am Thailand time. 
I wrote this as my....your...our? first real repository. 

May this be a proper start for our coding! Whether we keep our coding skils for hobby
or work, we can trace it back to this moment.

Signing off,

Joe
